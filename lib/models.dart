/// Indicates who is responsible (if known) for a failed request.
///
/// For example, if a client is using an invalid AWS access key, the returned
/// exception will indicate that there is an error in the request the caller
/// is sending. Retrying that same request will *not* result in a successful
/// response. The Client ErrorType indicates that there is a problem in the
/// request the user is sending (ex: incorrect access keys, invalid parameter
/// value, missing parameter, etc.), and that the caller must take some
/// action to correct the request before it should be resent. Client errors
/// are typically associated an HTTP error code in the 4xx range.
///
/// The Service ErrorType indicates that although the request the caller sent
/// was valid, the service was unable to fulfill the request because of
/// problems on the service's side. These types of errors can be retried by
/// the caller since the caller's request was valid and the problem occurred
/// while processing the request on the service side. Service errors will be
/// accompanied by an HTTP error code in the 5xx range.
///
/// Finally, if there isn't enough information to determine who's fault the
/// error response is, an Unknown ErrorType will be set.
